This is basillisk code that I will use for working on two-phase flow in the circular pipe (or maybe square duct in the future)

7/29/2025

Folder "Periodic" contain the code file that is using multigrid3D and periodic BC. 

  "compile" will generate another compiler "main_exe_uniform" that is for simulating the CFD  
  
Folder "test" is obsolete and will not be used anymore.
